# Hash Set Performance Comparison

## Overview
This project compares the performance of hash sets and lists for lookup operations. Hash sets are efficient for searching due to their average constant time complexity for the `in` operation, making them ideal for fast lookups.

## Complexity Summary
- **Lookup**: `O(1)` average, `O(n)` worst-case
- **Insertion**: `O(1)` average, `O(n)` worst-case
- **Deletion**: `O(1)` average, `O(n)` worst-case
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`

## Code Details
The code describes various application of sets in real world


## Conclusion
Hash sets are highly efficient for lookup, insertion, and deletion, making them a good choice for scenarios requiring fast access to unique items.
